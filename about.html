                    By the time you graduate with your physiology degree, you will have concrete and integrated knowledge about the way the human body works to keep us alive and well day in and day out. A degree in physiology is a phenomenal stepping stone to other health related fields as it encompasses the studies of biology, chemistry, biochemistry and even some physics (don’t worry, not that much!), allowing you to understand (as opposed to regurgitating facts) the dynamic processes of human physiology. That being said, the physiology undergraduate league of students (PULS) is there to help you along the way and make sure that your three years in physiology are truly a blast. <br /><br />

In the academics department, PULS organizes course packs, NTCs, and a student-lead mentoring program called “Synapse” which pairs every U1 student with a U3 student, giving you the info that only an experienced physio veteran could provide! To top that off, PULS also holds a host of social events because we understand that the secret to a successful undergrad is a balance between studies and a social life. PULS organizes BBQs, camping trips, a semi formal, wine and cheese, Mt. Ste-Anne ski trip and much much more!  <br /><br />

PULS is located in McMed at 1017 and our office hours are from 10:30-2:30 Monday to Friday. Everyone is always welcome to come by for info or just to hang out in between classes. We hope to meet you soon!

I'm a U3 student from Oakville, Ontario, self-identifying as a shameless night owl, master procrastinator, and lover of both caffeine and afternoon class scheduling. When not on that daily PHGY grind, I love reading, running, and exploring the city with my gem of a roomie. I truly can't wait to have a fantastic year with all of you - see you at PHGY Fridays!

My lab is on E2 at the Glen, so if anyone is there, come say hi! This year, I’ll be organizing and hosting PHGY 311 tutorials (my favourite course at McGill), as well as editing and producing the Journal of Undergraduate McGill Physiology Students (JUMPS). Come hang out in the office and feel free to ask me any questions! Cheers!

I am one of the few council members this year who were born and raised in Montreal. I grew up and went to elementary school in the east end, attended high school in the west island, and CEGEP downtown; I therefore pride myself on my navigation skills, along with a repertoire of songs I know the lyrics to. Naturally, I grew up on the ice rink, learning how to skate before I could run. However, my sports resume also includes soccer, karate, golf, speed skating, lacrosse, skiing, and ball hockey. I’m a huge foodie; I love trying new foods, as long as I’m not allergic to them. If you pass by the PULS office, I’ll be the short guy with long hair, wearing either a cap or a beanie, singing along to my iTunes library.

                    Hey everybody!!! I'm Taylor and I'll be one of the U3 reps this year! My job (along with my partner in crime Aleks) is to make sure all U3s are up to date with all things graduation, and to more importantly organize and plan events to end our time at McGill Physiology with a bang! I'm from a small town in the Gaspesie (the tip of the pinky sticking out of Quebec) and went to John Abbott College. Some of the things I love are: brunch, mimosas, bonfires, not missing the bus and last but not least, PHYSIOLOGY! Hope to meet you all at PHGY Fridays and all other events!

                    Hey! I'm Aleks and I am one of your U3 reps this year! I am a master of dedicating too much time to extracurriculars and then regretting it later, so I'm hoping this is not one of those situations. I'm originally from Bulgaria, however I spent most of my childhood in Vancouver, and one of my hobbies is dabbling in the sport of beach volleyball. I am currently doing an honours project with the one and only Dr. Shrier, along with taking some badass 4th year courses which you should definitely ask me about! If you ever stop by the PULS office, I'm the tall guy decked out in lululemon and 10tree apparel!

                    Hi friends!!! I’m Marissa and I’m one of your U2 representatives! If you’re ever looking for me in the PULS office, I’m the one wearing a hat (probably backwards) and dancing whether or not there is music playing. I’m from Toronto and I love camp and canoe trips, playing sports, watching hockey (go Leafs go), and eating ice cream. I’m part of a small but mighty squad of physiology students who also happen to love math. I can’t wait to meet and hang out with all of you at PHGY Fridays and enjoy the free beer, courtesy of PULS.

                    Hi Physiology! I'm Lunan, U2 Rep. Born in Beijing. Home is the dirt trail to the next adventure.  I enjoy listening to rain drip down forests while studying. I play quidditch and a few intermurals at McGill. I love learning about neurons and how our body systems work. It's knowledge you may apply anytime, anywhere. I'm also a pragmatic optimist and love quaint existential quotes. Hit me up anytime to chat about PHGY, pugs, or life ❤

I’m very excited to see what the year ahead unfolds, and to get to know my fellow PHGY family better. You’ll usually find me anywhere on campus that has a quiet spot for studying or reading, or on my several treks to and from McMed. When I’m not busy, I love to play tennis, and go on food runs around Montreal! If you’re struggling with anything in PHGY, or just need to blow off some steam, come to the office or poke me on campus and I’ll be more than happy to chill with y’all for a few!

You may see me around campus lounging on the grass outside Redpath, or in C4 desperately trying to finish up my meal plan before it goes away. When I’m not on campus, I’m usually on a hike or out rock climbing with friends. I can’t wait to meet you all at PHGY Friday, and hope to see you at all the awesome events coming up. It’s important to check the PHGY Facebook page weekly to meet other students, like yourself, who have chosen to be a part of the best major at McGill :)
